# 👋 Hey there, I’m Rudresh Sankpal

🎓 A passionate student on a mission to master the **MERN Stack** and build real-world impactful web apps.

🌐 I love turning ideas into clean, functional, and scalable products — especially those that **help people or solve real problems**.

💻 Currently focused on:
- Backend-heavy web applications (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
- Building fullstack projects to sharpen my job-readiness
- Exploring PostgreSQL & DevOps tools through internship work

🤝 I’m open to **collaborations** that challenge me to grow, contribute, and go deeper into real-world development.
